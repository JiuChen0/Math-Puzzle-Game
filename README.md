# Math-Puzzle-Game

It is a mathematical operation challenge game. The following are the rules of the game:

1. At the beginning of the game, the system generates four random numbers between -10 and 10, along with a target number in the same range. These numbers are displayed on the screen.

2. The player's task is to choose two of the four numbers to operate on by adding, subtracting and multiplying the three basic operations, making the final result equal to the target number.

3. Players can select numbers by clicking on the displayed number button, and then click on the displayed operator button to select an operator to perform the operation. The currently selected number and operator are displayed in the "Current Operation" area.

4. Once the player selects two numbers and an operator, clicking the "=" button will perform the operation and display the result. Both the operation performed and the result are displayed in the "Work Area" area.

5. The result of the operation is added back to the available numbers and the number used for the operation is removed.

6. When all numbers are used up, the player wins if the final result equals the target number; otherwise, the player loses. The number of wins and losses are displayed in the "Wins" and "Losses" areas respectively.

7. At any time, the player can restart the game by clicking the "RESTART" button.
